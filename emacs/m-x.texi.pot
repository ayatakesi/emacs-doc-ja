"Every Emacs command has a name that you can use to run it.  For convenience, "
"many commands also have key bindings.  You can run those commands by typing "
"the keys, or run them by name.  Most Emacs commands have no key bindings, so "
"the only way to run them is by name.  (@xref{Key Bindings}, for how to set "
"up key bindings.)"

"By convention, a command name consists of one or more words, separated by "

"To run a command by name, start with @kbd{M-x}, type the command name, then "
