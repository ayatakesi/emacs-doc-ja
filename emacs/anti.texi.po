msgid "For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about downgrading to Emacs version 29.4.  We hope you will enjoy the greater simplicity that results from the absence of many @w{Emacs @value{EMACSVER}} features."

msgid "Emacs can no longer be built for Android mobile devices.  We have removed the Android support because it was deemed unnecessary, what with the screens of the mobile devices becoming smaller and smaller as you move back in time.  We expect Android users to enjoy the much simpler text editors available on their devices.  As a nice bonus, removing Android support allowed us to get rid of gobs of related files, thus making the release tarballs much leaner."

msgid "We also dropped support for sophisticated input methods that include text conversions, again because those are mostly needed on mobile and hand-held devices, which we gradually remove from Emacs in each past version."

msgid "Like its newer releases, Emacs 29 can still be built with support of native compilation of Lisp programs.  However, in preparation for removal of this feature in some previous version, we've made the native compiler support off by default; you will now have to request it explicitly at configure time.  This makes the default Emacs build process much faster."

msgid "JSON interfaces slowly move into oblivion as past years come closer, so we have removed our internal implementation of JSON; you will now need to build Emacs with the libjansson library, if you need JSON.  Eventually, we plan on removing JSON support from Emacs altogether; this move will make the removal much simpler."

msgid "Various Help commands no longer turn on Outline minor mode.  With less material to display in the *Help* buffers, due to removing of excess documentation from Emacs, we think using outlining is an unnecessary complication, as scrolling through plain text is so much simpler."

msgid "To make Emacs configuration simpler and easier to control, the tool bar can now be displayed only in its natural and logical position: on the top of the frame; no more of that @code{tool-bar-position} nonsense with tool bars on the bottom.  For the same reasons @code{modifier-bar-mode} is now gone."

msgid "The command @code{recover-file} no longer lets you display the diffs between a file and its auto-save file.  You either want to recover a file or you don't; confusing users with a third alternative when they are anxious already by the possibility of losing precious edits is considered a bad idea, certainly so as we move further towards smaller, simpler Emacs."

msgid "Several languages and input methods, which will fall in disuse as you move back in time, were removed.  This includes Urdu, Pashto, and Sindhi languages, and the input method for the Colemak keyboard layout.  Many @kbd{C-x 8} key sequences, including those which insert various quotation characters and guillemets, were deleted for the same reason."

msgid "The user option @code{shell-command-guess-functions} and the context menu @samp{Open With} in Dired are gone.  We trust Emacs users to always know themselves which shell command is the appropriate one for a given file, so no guessing by Dired is needed, or welcome.  The @code{dired-do-open} command was deleted for the same reasons."
