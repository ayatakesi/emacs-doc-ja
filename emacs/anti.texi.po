msgid "Emacs can no longer be built for Android mobile devices.  We have removed the Android support because it was deemed unnecessary, what with the screens of the mobile devices becoming smaller and smaller as you move back in time.  We expect Android users to enjoy the much simpler text editors available on their devices.  As a nice bonus, removing Android support allowed us to get rid of gobs of related files, thus making the release tarballs much leaner."

#| msgid "Like its newer releases, Emacs 28 can still be built with support of native compilation of Lisp programs.  However, in preparation for removal of this feature in some previous version, we've deleted the capability of ahead-of-time native compilation of all the Lisp files that come with Emacs.  This makes the Emacs build process much faster."
msgid "Like its newer releases, Emacs 29 can still be built with support of native compilation of Lisp programs.  However, in preparation for removal of this feature in some previous version, we've made the native compiler support off by default; you will now have to request it explicitly at configure time.  This makes the default Emacs build process much faster."
msgstr "新しいリリースと同じように、Emacs 28でもLispプログラムのネイティブコンパイルのサポートとともにコンパイルが可能です。とはいえ以前のあるバージョンにおいて行われるこの機能の削除にたいする準備として、わたしたちはEmacsに同梱されている全Lispファイルの事前ネイティブコンパイルの機能を削除しました。これによりEmacsのビルドプロセスがより高速になりました。"

Eventually, we plan on removing JSON support from Emacs altogether; this move will make the removal much simpler."

You either want to recover a file or you don't; confusing users with a third alternative when they are anxious already by the possibility of losing precious edits is considered a bad idea, certainly so as we move further towards smaller, simpler Emacs."

Many @kbd{C-x 8} key sequences, including those which insert various quotation characters and guillemets, were deleted for the same reason."
