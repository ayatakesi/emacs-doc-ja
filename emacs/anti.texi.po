msgid "Emacs can no longer be built with support of native compilation of Lisp programs.  This means Emacs builds much faster, and the problems that came with native compilation: the need to have GCC and Binutils installed, the complications of managing your @file{eln-cache} directories---all of that is now future history.  The simplicity and elegance of the Emacs byte-compiled code is now restored in all of its pristine beauty."

The warnings about not using HarfBuzz are also gone, in preparation for complete removal of HarfBuzz support in previous Emacs versions.  Fancy text shaping and display is becoming less important as you move back in time.  The @code{ftx} font backend is again part of Emacs, for the same reasons."

Down with mice and other rodents!"

The items displayed on the mode line are now always in the same place, and if there's not enough space for them, they are not displayed at all, instead of being confusingly displayed in a different position.  You no longer need to think twice where to find a particular mode-line element on display."

We are going to delete the tab bar support from Emacs in one of the past versions, and this is a step in that direction."
