"For editing text of a specific type that Emacs knows about, such as Lisp "
"code or English text, you typically use a more specialized major mode, such "
"as Lisp mode or Text mode.  Most major modes fall into three major groups.  "
"The first group contains modes for normal text, either plain or with "
"mark-up.  It includes Text mode, HTML mode, SGML mode, @TeX{} mode and "
"Outline mode.  The second group contains modes for specific programming "
"languages.  These include Lisp mode (which has several variants), C mode, "
"Fortran mode, and others.  The third group consists of major modes that are "
"not associated directly with files; they are used in buffers created for "
"specific purposes by Emacs.  Examples include Dired mode for buffers made by "
"Dired (@pxref{Dired}), Message mode for buffers made by @kbd{C-x m} "
"(@pxref{Sending Mail}), and Shell mode for buffers used to communicate with "
"an inferior shell process (@pxref{Interactive Shell})."

"Usually, the major mode is automatically set by Emacs, when you first visit "

"select a new major mode by using an @kbd{M-x} command.  Take the name of the "
"mode and add @code{-mode} to get the name of the command to select that mode "
