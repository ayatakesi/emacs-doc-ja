"For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about "
"downgrading to Emacs version 28.2.  We hope you will enjoy the greater "
"simplicity that results from the absence of many @w{Emacs @value{EMACSVER}} "

"Like its newer releases, Emacs 28 can still be built with support of native "
"compilation of Lisp programs.  However, in preparation for removal of this "
"feature in some previous version, we've deleted the capability of "
"ahead-of-time native compilation of all the Lisp files that come with "
"Emacs.  This makes the Emacs build process much faster."

"Emacs can no longer be built with the tree-sitter library, so you no longer "
"will need to look for and install the grammar libraries for the languages in "
"which you want to program.  Similarly, all the modes that are based on the "
"tree-sitter library were deleted, leaving you with just one major mode for "
"every supported programming language: no more need to decide whether to turn "
"the tree-sitter supported modes on and try using their parser-based "
"fontification, indentation, and other features.  For some languages and file "
"types, this means no major mode at all, leaving you with the venerable "
"Fundamental mode as the natural, high-performance choice.  For example, Go, "
"Rust, and CMake files no longer have any major modes for editing their files "
"--- another milestone towards a simpler, leaner Emacs."

"In line with simplifying and eventually removing the native-compilation "

"and makes your configure-time decision regarding native compilation in Emacs "
"clear-cut: either Emacs compiles non-preloaded Lisp packages to native code "
"only before using it, or it never uses native compilation at all; no more "
"half measures and special exceptions.  For similar reasons, "
"@code{native-compile-prune-cache} and @code{startup-redirect-eln-cache} "

"We've deleted the special code and features which allowed Emacs to present "

"unnecessary complication."

"Commands to scale and rotate images are once again bound to single keys like "
