"A @dfn{key sequence}, or @dfn{key} for short, is a sequence of one or more "

"A prefix key combines with the following input event to make a longer key "

"pause for longer than a second, it echoes the @kbd{C-x} key to prompt for "
"that input; @pxref{Echo Area}).  @kbd{C-x} combines with the next input "
"event to make a two-event key sequence, which could itself be a prefix key "
"(such as @kbd{C-x 4}), or a complete key (such as @kbd{C-x C-f}).  There is "

"@kbd{C-x 6}.)  This list is not cast in stone; if you customize Emacs, you "
"can make new prefix keys.  You could even eliminate some of the standard "
"ones, though this is not recommended for most users; for example, if you "
