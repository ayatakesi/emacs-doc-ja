"Global Auto Revert Mode normally only reverts file buffers.  There are two "
"ways to auto-revert certain non-file buffers: by enabling Auto Revert Mode "
"in those buffers (using @kbd{M-x auto-revert-mode}); and by setting "
"@code{global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers} to a non-@code{nil} value.  The "
"latter enables Auto Reverting for all types of buffers for which it is "
"implemented (listed in the menu below)."

"Like file buffers, non-file buffers should normally not revert while you are "
"working on them, or while they contain information that might get lost after "
"reverting.  Therefore, they do not revert if they are modified.  This can "
"get tricky, because deciding when a non-file buffer should be marked "
"modified is usually more difficult than for file buffers."

"Another tricky detail is that, for efficiency reasons, Auto Revert often "
"does not try to detect all possible changes in the buffer, only changes that "
"are major or easy to detect.  Hence, enabling auto-reverting for a non-file "
"buffer does not always guarantee that all information in the buffer is "
"up-to-date, and does not necessarily make manual reverts useless."

"At the other extreme, certain buffers automatically revert every "
"@code{auto-revert-interval} seconds.  (This currently only applies to the "
"Buffer Menu.)  In this case, Auto Revert does not print any messages while "
"reverting, even when @code{auto-revert-verbose} is non-@code{nil}."

"Some non-file buffers can be updated reliably by file notification on their "
"default directory; Dired buffers is an example.  The major mode can indicate "
"this by setting @code{buffer-auto-revert-by-notification} to a "
"non-@code{nil} value in that buffer, allowing Auto Revert to avoid periodic "
"polling.  Such notification does not include changes to files in that "

"Dired buffers only auto-revert when the file list of the buffer's main "
"directory changes (e.g., when a new file is added or deleted).  They do not "
"auto-revert when information about a particular file changes (e.g., when the "
"size changes) or when inserted subdirectories change.  To be sure that "
"@emph{all} listed information is up to date, you have to manually revert "
"using @kbd{g}, @emph{even} if auto-reverting is enabled in the Dired "
"buffer.  Sometimes, you might get the impression that modifying or saving "
"files listed in the main directory actually does cause auto-reverting.  This "
"is because making changes to a file, or saving it, very often causes changes "
"in the directory itself; for instance, through backup files or auto-save "
"files.  However, this is not guaranteed."

"If the Dired buffer is marked modified and there are no changes you want to "
"protect, then most of the time you can make auto-reverting resume by "
"manually reverting the buffer using @kbd{g}.  There is one exception.  If "
"you flag or mark files, you can safely revert the buffer.  This will not "
"erase the flags or marks (unless the marked file has been deleted, of "
"course).  However, the buffer will stay modified, even after reverting, and "
"auto-reverting will not resume.  This is because, if you flag or mark files, "
"you may be working on the buffer and you might not want the buffer to change "
"without warning.  If you want auto-reverting to resume in the presence of "
"marks and flags, mark the buffer non-modified using @kbd{M-~}.  However, "
"adding, deleting or changing marks or flags will mark it modified again."
