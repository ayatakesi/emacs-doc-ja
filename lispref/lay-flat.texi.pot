"We have bound this manual using a new @dfn{lay-flat} binding technology.  "
"This type of binding allows you to open a soft cover book so that it lays "
"flat on a table without creasing the binding."

"In order to make the book lay flat properly, you need to crack the binding.  "
"To do this, divide the book into two sections and bend it so that the front "
"and back covers meet.  Do not worry; the pages are sewn and glued to the "
"binding, and will not fall out easily.  The outer cardboard binding itself "
"is designed so that it will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback "
"binding will.  Bend the book several times in this manner, dividing it in a "
"different place each time and pressing the pages flat and open.  With use, "
"the binding will become flexible and the pages will lay flat without needing "
"to be pushed or held down."
