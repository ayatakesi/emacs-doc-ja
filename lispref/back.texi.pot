"Most of the GNU Emacs text editor is written in the programming language "
"called Emacs Lisp.  You can write new code in Emacs Lisp and install it as "
"an extension to the editor.  However, Emacs Lisp is more than a mere "
"extension language; it is a full computer programming language in its own "
"right.  You can use it as you would any other programming language."

"Because Emacs Lisp is designed for use in an editor, it has special features "
"for scanning and parsing text as well as features for handling files, "
"buffers, displays, subprocesses, and so on.  Emacs Lisp is closely "
"integrated with the editing facilities; thus, editing commands are functions "
"that can also conveniently be called from Lisp programs, and parameters for "
"customization are ordinary Lisp variables."

"This manual describes Emacs Lisp.  Generally speaking, the earlier chapters "
"describe features of Emacs Lisp that have counterparts in many programming "
"languages, and later chapters describe features that are peculiar to Emacs "
"Lisp or relate specifically to editing."
