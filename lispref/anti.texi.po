We are working hard on removing the lexical-binding support in some past Emacs version, and this small step advances us back to that change."

msgid "To reduce the amount of code in Emacs related to unimportant features, we've removed the variables @code{global-minor-modes} and @code{local-minor-modes}.  If your Lisp program needs to determine whether some minor mode is in effect, it will have to test explicitly for every mode.  We don't expect anyone to miss those fancy variables."

msgid "The default preference for servicing sub-processes that produce output at a high rate, and the associated variable @code{process-prioritize-lower-fds}, have been removed.  Moving back in time means fewer and fewer programs can produce such high-rate output, so this features becomes just useless crud."

msgid "Emacs modules can no longer provide interactive functions, or install finalizers, nor open channels to existing pipe sub-processes.  All this is extra ballast, especially since we plan on removing modules in some past Emacs version.  The @code{make_unibyte_string} module API was removed for the same reason."

msgid "To keep Emacs clean and elegant, we've removed the @code{print-integers-as-characters} option.  Recognizing characters by their decimal codes is a basic requirement for Emacs Lisp programmers, and with the expected decrease in use of Unicode characters, this will be soon limited to ASCII only: surely something you all can master!"
