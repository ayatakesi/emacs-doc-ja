msgid "Lisp objects are again implemented on the C level as integer types, not as pointers.  This might be a small step for Emacs Lisp users, but it's a giant leap for the Emacs developers who work on the C level, since it is now again easy to print Lisp object in the debugger in the decimal format, which is so much easier for debugging.  It also makes calling Emacs functions from the debugger easier, and allows us to freely mix integers and Lisp objects in the C code."

msgid "The test suite was removed from the distribution tarball.  We believe that tests need seldom if ever be run, certainly not by the end users.  Removing the tests from the tarball makes it much smaller, which is important since disk space becomes more and more at premium as you move back in time."

This both makes Emacs smaller (a worthy goal by itself), and removes the complications and additional complexity related with installing module support files and letting random shared objects an opportunity to be loaded into Emacs and mess with it."

msgid "You now must activate any installed packages only after loading your init files.  That requires an explicit call to @code{package-initialize} in your init file, which is a Good Thing, as it makes you think seriously where and indeed whether you'd like your packages to become available to your sessions.  Simplicity should tramp convenience!"

We consider the availability of these fonts more important than a random crash here and there, especially since the use of these fonts for displaying Emoji will become less and less important as we travel back in time, and will completely disappear in some past Emacs version."

msgid "The predicates @code{display-blink-cursor-p} and @code{display-symbol-keys-p} were deleted.  They are rarely if ever needed, and can easily be substituted by appropriate calls to old and proven APIs like @code{display-graphic-p}.  As an additional bonus, writing Lisp programs that depend on this functionality will make sure the programmer understands better what exactly is the required features of the display terminal."

msgid "Relative directories in the value of the @env{HOME} environment variable are once again interpreted relative to the @code{default-directory} of the current buffer.  This is much simpler, and also allows @env{HOME} to resolve to a different place in different buffers, which allows some interesting applications."

msgid "For the same reasons, @code{file-name-absolute-p} now again considers @file{~foo} an absolute file name, even if there's no known user @samp{foo}.  This means a Lisp program which uses such file names will always work the same on any system, regardless of its known users."

We decided that functions which signal errors require more complex code from Lisp programs which use them, and found this complexity unjustified when returning @code{nil} will do."

msgid "The function @code{read-char-from-minibuffer} was deleted.  We decided that @code{read-char} should be enough for any Lisp program that needs to ask the user for a single-character input, in recognition of the fact that nothing makes Emacs Lisp hackers rejoice more than the need to sit down and write yet another interactive question-and-answer function, and make it optimal for each specific case.  Consequently, no history is provided for such responses (why would someone want history of single-key strokes, anyway?)."
